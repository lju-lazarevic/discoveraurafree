:imagesdir: img

Twitter has been one of our favorite social networks to model, import and query, because it is a rich, multi-layered social graph with followship, posts, replies, mentions, hashtags, URLs and more.

The Twitter API is although limited, very rich in data and you can easily turn it into an insightful graph as we did, e.g. for [Twitter Trolls^], or the [Community Graph^]

With the exodus from Twitter, Mastodon and the Fediverse became much more interesting for a lot of people.
Also the underlying ActivityPub API and infrastructure that powers much more than just Mastodon got more attention.
