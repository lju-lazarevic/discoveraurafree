Wrong! Most routing services produce a default route that is the shortest distance between two ports. But the shortest distance might not be the safest (can you say pirates? storms?), or the most efficient in terms of GHG emissions. Furthermore, most routing services use unstable infrastructure, struggle with big data feeds, and offer limited visualization options. For these reasons, OrbitMI decided to build its own routing service solution. To build this world-class, enterprise-grade service, we needed a graph that could process large volumes of data, provide reliable storage, serve and support spatial – in addition to linear and tabular datasets – delivered in real time (and at scale), as well as a library of pathfinding algorithms. Our goal was to develop a routing service to give ship owners and managers (really anyone in the industry), the ability to create and select the smartest route for their vessels. Routes can be optimized for distance, safety, speed, GHG emissions, weather, or revenue, among others.",Basic to Intermediate,William,Lyon,William Lyon,Developer Advocate,William Lyon is a Developer Advocate at Neo4j where he helps developers be successful with graphs.

Data lakes collocate data but do not create synergy because they lack structure and context. When the time comes to engineer features, data lakes do not provide a means to maintain digital threads. The burden of preserving context falls to users, who pass tribal knowledge from one to the next through word of mouth or documentation. This process creates bottlenecks in data processing and analytics, resulting in loss of clarity over time. To overcome these challenges, Ontology-Driven Design operates on the premise that data integration should be governed by knowledge. In this paradigm, domain knowledge is modeled ontologically, which kills two birds with one stone. Firstly, the domain knowledge serves as an integration layer for disparate data. Secondly, the combination of data and ontology results in a context-rich graph that preserves domain knowledge in a digital thread.

However, because the user can enter text with few constraints, programmatically aggregating individual responses into a cohesive whole can be extremely difficult. Similarities between individual responses can illuminate constellations within the data that outline a bigger picture. Graph architectures are the ideal mechanism by which these connections can be revealed and explored. With the recent advent of transformer deep learning models, natural language can now be embedded into vectors that more completely capture the semantic meaning of the words. Graph analysis of similarity scores calculated between transformer embeddings provides the big picture view that is often so elusive. Thus, through a combination of deep learning, shallow learning, and graph algorithms we can extract greater insight from free-form text.

The ETL loads family tree data in GECOM format, consumer DNA test results, and genealogist-curated files that create links between graphs. 

The analytics provide new insights and actionable recommendations for further genealogy research. GFG traversals collect concatenated strings to create Ahnentafel numbers and enable filtering on X-linked inheritance and other patterns. Traversals from the family tree through DNA matches to chromosome segment data find triangulation groups and monophyletic segments aligned with specific family tree branches. Graph algorithms from Neo4j Graph Data Science reveal communities aligned with family tree branches. Hierarchical trees include patrilineal trees, DNA haplotrees, ORDPATH-enhanced renderings, and hybrids linking these together. Chromosome painting and 3D renderings help users interpret the results. Recommendations include manageable sets of persons from a pool of over 250,000 DNA matches. There are many opportunities for further development of graph analytics in this billion-dollar industry.

At Northrop Grumman, we have pioneered a graph-based solution to this problem by utilizing the GRAND Stack (GraphQL, React, Apollo, Neo4j). Our application, called Kraken, merges data from multiple sources into a graph database. This architecture simplifies master data management by decreasing data duplication, tracking changes through digital threads, and creating an ASOT (authoritative source of truth) for data.

179,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,Healthcare,Knowledge Graph,Data Scientists,Lightning Talk,"Data Science, Knowledge Graphs",Build a Better Healthcare Chatbot with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph,"The need for automated assistants for healthcare is well-established. Medical providers benefit from an automated assistant who helps to triage patients, summarize changes in a patient’s condition, and suggests possible drugs or procedures. Similar needs arise in home healthcare, where automated assistants connect caregivers and physicians to monitor the patient’s health and review treatment options. Chatbots are seen as a promising technology for such mediation. However, such systems lack the reasoning capabilities required to explain the rationale behind a recommendation and to communicate with the end user. Medical AI systems must understand the relationships between symptoms, medical conditions, drugs, and procedures. These relationships are most naturally represented as a knowledge graph. In this session, we will demonstrate a neural-symbolic reasoning system that builds a symbolic representation of clinical knowledge from multi-modal electronic healthcare records data using a combination of scalable graph data mining and deep learning. We will showcase a natural language interface that allows an end user to interact with the system to identify high-risk patients, review summaries and recommendations, and improve the knowledge graph and models by answering questions.",Intermediate,Khushbu,Agarwal,Khushbu Agarwal,Senior Research Scientist,"Khushbu Agarwal is a senior computer scientist in the Data Sciences and Machine Intelligence group at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with over 15 years experience in data analytics.

185,CropIn Technology Solutions,Agriculture,Knowledge Graph,General,Lightning Talk,Knowledge Graphs,Knowledge Graph Representation for Disease Risk Estimation in Crops,"Crop diseases have the potential to cause devastating epidemics in the entire agriculture supply chain. It accounts for an average of more than 40 percent loss in production. Therefore, there is a need to predict the possibility of a disease affecting a crop in the early stage. To address this problem, we are creating a large knowledge graph representation of crops and diseases. The knowledge graph captures all the agronomy knowledge about crops, their diseases, disease symptoms (relationships), and recommendations to prevent these diseases. Therefore, the knowledge graph becomes the backbone of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solutions that we are developing for early risk estimation of disease. The agronomy knowledge is extracted from various document sources by using natural language processing operations, and the knowledge graph is built from that. The knowledge graph is also incremented from the huge field data collected in the organization. We are leveraging the power of Neo4j as a tool to build an extensive knowledge graph. The advantage of a knowledge graph is that whole information of crop and disease eco-systems comes in a single representation, and therefore it becomes very easy to scale our solution for any number of crops and diseases.",Intermediate,Jitendra,Kumar,Jitendra Kumar,Product & Innovation Lead,"Jitendra Kumar currently serves as the AI Product and Innovation Lead at CropIn Technology Solutions, solving many interesting and challenging problems of agriculture and sustainability through remote sensing, satellite imaging, and artificial intelligence.

197,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Financial,GDS-UC,Data Scientists,Lightning Talk,Data Science,Are Economists Right or Wrong? Connecting Patent Data in Neo4j,"Relationships in and across data are naturally represented by graphs. This is particularly true for patent data, which plays a huge role in economic growth. As economists begin to appreciate the network effects in many economic variables, interest in graphs is increasing. However, graph databases are not widely used in economic research, and many econometricians still rely on data stored in tables. In this talk, we will see how Neo4j supports better inferences from economic variables. Specifically, we will evaluate economists' ideas about the knowledge economy and use Neo4j to verify, support, or reject them using US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data connecting patents, their inventors, and their owners.",Intermediate,Justin,Ho,Justin Ho,Undergraduate Researcher,"Justin Ho is an undergraduate researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, majoring in economics, computer science, and mathematics.

216,PwC,General,Security,Data Scientists,Lightning Talk,"Data Science, Security",Synthetic Graphs for Privacy: Lessons Learned and Key Takeaways,"
Synthetic graphs offer a powerful method for implementing privacy by design. We implemented several research-based algorithms on real-world data. In particular, we focused on two algorithms: synthetic graphs by Mittal et al. that adds nodes and edges to a graph while persevering their utility; and the uncertainty injection approach of Boldi et al. that introduces edge probabilities to obfuscate graph information. Although tested on research data, these algorithms posed certain challenges when using them on real-world data. This presentation will cover lessons learned and the modifications we applied when processing data with personally-identifiable information.

248,IndyKite Inc,General,CoreDB,General,Lightning Talk,Best Practices,A Schema Migration Tool for the Neo4j Database,"Effective database change management relies on proper schema handling. Schemas are the ""blueprint"" of the database – they are instrumental for modeling and performance gains. With a strict schema, rolling out new changes or rolling back to an older version is a function of schema version control, where incremental changes are consistently tracked. This is particularly applicable for relational databases, where the schema defines the data model, type definitions, relationships, indexes, and constraints. Graph databases can be described as schema optional, or schema flexible, because there are no standard ways to manage schemas and version control in a graph database. Defining indexes and constraints in a schema is useful, but without a strict model, it's impossible to perform automatic change management. Scripts are necessary for modifying indexes and data according to the changes introduced. Database change management for graph databases, therefore, becomes increasingly challenging and is often characterized by manual efforts (and chaos), which is a hindrance to efficient CI/CD pipelines and high-performing development teams. In this talk, we'll describe in more detail how we developed a schema migration tool for graph databases that's used for automating the change management process.
