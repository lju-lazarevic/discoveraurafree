386573,Keynote: Social Network Interventions,"A deep understanding of social networks can be used to create an artificial tipping point, changing population behavior by fostering behavioral cascades. Here, we experimentally test this proposition. We show that network-based targeting substantially increases population-level adoption of new behaviors. In part, this works by driving indirect treatment effects among the nontargeted members of the population (among people who were not initially part of the treatment group but who were affected by treatment of others in their population). The techniques we demonstrate can be easily implemented in global health (and elsewhere), as they do not require knowledge of the whole network. The novel pair-targeting technique explored here is particularly powerful and easy to implement.",Nicholas Christakis,Full Session 30-45 min,Introductory and overview,,"Knowledge Graph, Featured",General,,Accepted,19 Sep 2022 09:53 PM,85612b2a-6903-46a6-a8dc-8a17e79ab953

384329,Graph Modeling: The Shadow Graph,"One of the best things about working with graphs is the flexibility of the graph model.

As part of a tennis predictions app that I've been building, I needed to come up with a way to represent the actual result of a match alongside the predictions done by participants. 

After trying a few approaches, I eventually settled on what I like to think of as a shadow graph. We keep the initial subgraph representing each match, but then attach a match prediction subgraph to that match for each player, with precisely the same structure.

This technique makes it easy to add new predictions to the graph, as well as query the graph to compute prediction accuracy.

In this talk, I'll show the graph model before doing a quick walk-through of the model in action based on my (not very good!) predictions of tennis tournaments in 2022.

375636,Demystifying Graph Analytics With Visualization,"If you’re serious about finding insights in your connected data sets, graph analytics are essential. These sophisticated algorithms from the world of graph theory often assign numeric scores or rankings to nodes to help make sense of the structure of the network. But business users shouldn’t need data scientist-level expertise to interpret graph analytics results. They simply want to know what’s really going on in a network: who has the most influence? Who is well connected? Who belongs to which hidden subgroup?

So how do we help users understand graph analytics in an intuitive way so that they can make fast business decisions?

Graph visualization is a proven method for displaying analytical data to non-experts. It’s so effective because it binds analytically-derived metrics to instantly recognizable visual properties of nodes and links - think color, size, node icons and link widths. That’s how developers create powerful graph visualization applications that reveal insights which often remain hidden in traditional graph representations.

In this talk, data visualization expert and Cambridge Intelligence’s chief product evangelist, Corey Lanum demonstrates how to present graph analytics in a way that users can understand easily. Using Neo4j’s graph algorithms alongside complementary front-end analytics techniques from KeyLines and ReGraph graph visualization toolkits, he’ll focus on a fascinating data set featuring large charitable donations made in the United States. He’ll reveal key donors, recipients, communities and interesting donation patterns through the universal language of visualization.

375962,Graph Database Techniques to Reduce Risk and Innovate,"This session will look at 3 unique graph prototypes recently developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) to tackle challenges encountered by our DoD clients in cybersecurity, risk management, and policy.
The first prototype aids in analysis of complex software obsolescence tracking data. Using graph techniques, we analyze existing data and processes to show the relationships between the software products as well as system impacts and risks when needing to perform upgrades due the end-of-support issues. These techniques allowed for enhanced risk management activities for the program by identifying risks and system impacts early.
The second prototype is a variant of the first, but instead aids in the analysis of data related to a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Graphing SBOM data from a generated SPDX formatted file is a novel technique in visualizing relationships in the components that make up software intensive systems.
The final prototype involves the graphing and subsequent analysis of a document examining roles, responsibilities, artifacts, policies, and guidance.  This analysis allowed for the identification of missing artifacts from the process as well as impacts to the processes should the applicable guidance or policies implementing the process change.",Michael Bandor,Full Session 30-45 min,Introductory and overview,none,Knowledge Graph,Aerospace and Defense,US-Central,Accepted,19 Aug 2022 08:46 PM,981b020c-2eb8-422c-be5c-7775a375982b

378837,Discover Invisible Patterns in Your Data: Connect Google Sheets Tables and Neo4j,"Let your table data tell a graph-connected data story. 

We are used to thinking about data as a table, and we have used tables at school and at work. But this type of data is hard to navigate and makes it difficult to discover patterns, unlock insights, and inform timely decisions. Recently, we moved to cloud-based technology and learned to use Google Sheets. The cloud makes it easy to share information and collaborate, but we didn't move away from table data; it is still in columns and rows.

The Neo4j graph database allows you to make sense of data and discover invisible patterns. Once you have insights and confidence about what your data is telling you, you can explain it to others and craft a marketing headline that will help your business grow.

374665,The Heisenbugs - Finding Collusion Among Malicious Entities Through Knowledge Graph,"Life as a malware researcher (and security researcher in general) requires one to continuously develop the intuitive ability to see patterns, connections among seemingly unrelated entities. 

In this talk, we shall discuss how we can apply the concept of Knowledge Graph as a critical aid to solve a challenging technical scenario often faced by a security researcher. We can consider this scenario equivalent to an Asimovian Robot’s dilemma in taking a decision adhering to the “Laws of Robotics”.

First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

If a Robot can not reason an intended action’s precedence according to three laws, it would go into an unstable mode (“Brain Freeze”) and cease to operate. 

Sometimes, this kind of scenario is also common in analyzing a malware in silo. In this talk, we shall see how we can build a graph database schema from the scratch that is relevant to the cross platform executables (Android, macOS, Linux, Windows) and build a knowledge graph organically through automation and manual analysis results that can provide answers to the researchers at the right time with right directions without the need for the researchers to explicitly ask for it. Afterall, with the proliferation of data, the answers are everywhere, it's all about asking the right questions.

We can employ either AWS Lex, GPT-3 or Alan AI as the natural language understanding engine. This chatbot works with English and can understand German, Chinese and Japanese. Users can dictate or type the questions. Doctor.ai then converts the questions into Cypher. It queries the Neo4j graph, gets the answers and formulates them back in the target languages. With Neovis, we can display the Neo4j results in graphs, too.

Because it is completely in the cloud, Doctor.ai can scale automatically. It is also easy to use. Because Doctor.ai is also a framework, we can use different products to fulfil the same function.

375404,Taking Application Security Insights to the Next Level With Data Fabric and NeoSemantics,"Recently, exploits detected in open-source software packages (as log4j) increased the industry attention to find a solution to monitor, detect, prevent, and repair vulnerabilities and weaknesses in applications. To do so, organizations use detection methods to discover vulnerable software components, such as static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.
These scanning methods usually discover security flaws in the code, and lack of providing the full picture required for a security expert to analyze the software. For example, how an attacker could exploit the detected flaw? And which countermeasures an organization could use to prevent this exploit?
At this point, publicly available cybersecurity knowledge graphs as D3FEND and OWASP OdTM step in. These knowledge graphs hold information of vulnerabilities, their associated attack techniques, and the corresponding countermeasures. A projection of the application flaws over these fused knowledge graphs, allows the augmentation of each flaw with the context of the potential attack techniques, and the corresponding countermeasures. In this session we demonstrate how this is done. First, we build a federated knowledge base of the D3FEND and OdTM knowledge graphs via Neo4J Data Fabric and NeoSemantics technologies. Then, we build a knowledge graph representation of a cybersecurity finding report composed of flaws detected in the application code. Finally, we use a data federation graph query to associate each detected flaw with information from the knowledge base.",Gal Engelberg,Lighting Talk 10-15 min,Advanced,,"Analytics, Knowledge Graph, Security, Cypher, Other",General,IST / UTC+2,Accepted,17 Aug 2022 03:23 PM,8f2fc841-44f5-4cc2-9e23-addd9c17a6fb

Health data, in general, is often siloed and inaccessible. The FAIR data principles have contributed to overcome this situation and make health data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable – but mostly within their very specific data domains.
Using the examples of COVID-19 data and data from health studies in epidemiology provided by the NFDI4health study hub, we showcase how a knowledge graph integrates multiple open data sources using a Neo4j graph database. It connects previously disparate data domains, and then offers specific interfaces for data access and exploration. 

The focus of our talk will be on introducing the main code repositories included in the HealthECCO graph, explaining the workflow behind the data loading pipeline, and showcasing the usefulness of Neo4j for health data exploration. Whenever a new data source should be added, the pipeline can be modified to integrate the (fully annotated) data set.","Lea Gütebier, Ron Henkel, Dagmar Waltemath",Full Session 30-45 min,Intermediate,,"Knowledge Graph, Featured",Healthcare,,Accepted,8 Sep 2022 11:47 AM,"e078e408-bbe1-4c2c-a9e2-fec2afc46b93, 14e6ce08-cdcb-4fe1-9eb9-894b34d52c6c, 8804f562-a13a-4a03-922a-17e51d90bc3d"

379610,Genealogy With Different Graph Technologies for Data Collection and Visualization,"This presentation is about graphs for humans. The use case is an individual project to collect and display genealogy information. 

TheBrain is a great User Interface to collect scraps of information as they show up in no specific order and easily relate them in a meaningful way, that is in a graph structure.
It’s great for data collection, but global visualisation of the graph is not appropriate, for example to visualise remote common ancestors .

So I wanted a tool that has a family tree specific layout algorithm,
and that can also display a portrait when available, 
as well as dates and places of birth and death because they are essential to keep track of who you‘re dealing with, as the data set becomes larger.
Gramps is an open source genealogy tool, with add-ons that can produce such visualisations.

Problem was theBrain graph model is not the same as the one used in gramps,
so Neo4j has been used as a pivot graph technology to convert the data graph structure.

The presentation will describe the data collection and export / import process from theBrain to gramps via Neo4j,
and give examples of different interesting uses of graph patterns, that is graph database queries.

We will also discuss visualisation issues and solutions for this genealogy graph use case,
among other things, for fine tuned calculus to make information of interest stand out, which can be used for many usecase.",Véronique Gendner,Full Session 30-45 min,Introductory and overview,,"Visualization, Cypher, Database, API/Drivers (Python",General,,Accepted,30 Aug 2022 09:05 AM,a7a84641-7fc8-4ff8-83f0-85cf5ade51c4
380269,From Node to Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Every graph can be represented as an adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the elements indicate whether pairs of nodes are connected.
Such a matrix can be regarded as a high-dimensional representation of the network. Now imagine you have a graph with a million nodes.
In an adjacency matrix, each node would be represented with a row in the matrix that has a million elements.
Suppose you want to train a machine learning model and somehow use the network structure information as an input feature.
Using the adjacency matrix as an input to your model could all sorts of problem from having too many input features to overfitting.
In practice, you often want to embed a node's local representation to compare nodes with similar neighborhood topology instead of using all relationships between nodes as a feature input.
Node embedding techniques try to solve these issues by learning lower-dimensional node representation for any given network.
The learned node representations or embeddings should automatically encode the network structure so that the similarity in the embedding space approximates the similarity in the network.
Additionally, knowledge graph embedding models aim to encode both the nodes as well as the relationships in the embedding space.

Therefore and after plenty of requests from the community, the Neo4j team decided to provide an async version of the official Neo4j driver for Python. This feature has been recently released with version 5.0.

In this session, we'll dive into how to turn a sync Python application using the official Neo4j driver into an async one as well as some common pitfalls when writing async Python code and how that translates to the usage of our driver.

375798,Neo4j Migrations: The Lean Way of Applying Database Refactorings to Neo4j,"Neo4j-Migrations https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations has been created out of necessity:

- For integrating Spring Data Neo4j 6 with JHipster we have been looking for a dependency free tool to apply a couple of handful refactorings, like creating indexes and such
- We are trying to move people away from using the auto index manager in Neo4j-OGM. There is no such thing in SDN 6. The safer way is to run a handful of simple Cypher scripts

In early 2020 there was no tool that fitted the requirements:

- Dependency free (or almost dependency free)
- Working purely on the official Neo4j-Java-Driver (aka Bolt-Driver), and not wrapping in into JDBC

While Liquigraph / Liquibase is an excellent tool, it basically does the opposite of what we want: It brings in a ton of dependencies and the need to make people aquainted with the concept of JDBC-Driver over Bolt (or HTTP).

Neo4j-Migrations has been in production with JHipster since summer 2020 and has evolved ever since

- It can run Cypher-Scripts (with everything you can do in Cypher),
  either in one big transaction or one transaction per statement per script
- It can run Java-based migrations: You get programmatic access to a managed session
- It records all migrations in a simple Graph
- It can use different databases in Neo4j enterprise for storing the migration graph and actual target database
- It can be applied to multiple target databases
- It supports a broad variety of callbacks (refactorings that are always applied)

It has extensions for Spring Boot and Quarkus.
The Spring Boot extension is part of Neo4j-Ops-Manager.
The Quarkus extension fully supports native deployments.

Last but not least and we think it's the most important feature: It comes as a native binary CLI, perfect for use in CI/CD systems.
