After clicking `Create Database` you can create a new *Neo4j AuraDB Free* instance.

Choose the "Empty Instance" option as we want to import our data ourselves.

On the Credentials popup, make sure to save the password somewhere safe, best is to download the credentials file, which you can also use for your app development.

The default username is always `neo4j`.

Then wait 2-3 minutes for your instance to be created.

Afterwards you can connect via the "Open" Button with Workspace (you'll need the password), which offers the "Import" (Data Importer), "Explore" (Neo4j Bloom) and "Query" (Neo4j Browser) tabs to work with your data.

On the database tile you can also find the connection URL: `neo4j+s://xxx.databases.neo4j.io` (it is also contained in your credentials env file).
