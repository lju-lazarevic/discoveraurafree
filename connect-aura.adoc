After clicking `Create Database` you can create a new *Neo4j AuraDB Free* instance.
Select a Region close to you and give it a name, e.g. *{db-name}*.

Choose the "blank database" option as we want to import our data ourselves.

On the Credentials popup, make sure to save the password somewhere safe. 
The default username is always `neo4j`.

Then wait 3-5 minutes for your instance to be created.

Afterwards you can connect via the `Query` Button with Neo4j Browser (you'll need the password), or `Import` to Data Importer and `Explore` with Neo4j Bloom

Then also the connection URL: `neo4j+s://xxx.databases.neo4j.io` is available and you can copy it to your credentials as you might need it later.

If you want to see examples for programmatically connecting to the database go to the "Connect" tab of your instance and pick the language of your choice
