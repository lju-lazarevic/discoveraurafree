A repo with cypher and examples from the Discover *Neo4j Aura Free* https://twitch.tv/neo4j[Twitch stream^]. All streams will roughly follow the following format:

* Review a data set
* Decide what questions to ask from it
* Put together an initial data model
* Load the data into https://dev.neo4j.com/discover-aura[Neo4j Aura Free^] and query!

Got a data set you'd like us to explore? Provided it's a public data set and can be accessed from a URI, let us know! Either raise an issue on the repo, or tweet @ellazal or @alexandererdl or @mesirii on Twitter.

== Join us live for the stream!

Every Monday: 8am UTC | 9am BST | 10am CEST | 1:30pm IST | 4pm SGT
https://twitch.tv/neo4j[On Twitch^]

Following along? Don't forget to get your https://dev.neo4j.com/discover-aura[*Free* Neo4j Aura instance^] up and running.
