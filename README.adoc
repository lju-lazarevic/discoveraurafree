A repo with cypher and examples from the Discover *Neo4j Aura Free* https://twitch.tv/neo4j[Twitch stream^]. All streams will roughly follow the following format:

* Review a data set
* Decide what questions to ask from it
* Put together an initial data model
* Load the data into https://dev.neo4j.com/discover-aura[Neo4j Aura Free^] and query!

Got a data set you'd like us to explore? Provided it's a public data set and can be accessed from a URI, let us know! Either raise an issue on the repo, or tweet @ellazal or @alexandererdl or @mesirii on Twitter.

== Join us live for the stream!

Every Monday alternating between 

* a "morning session" 8am UTC | 10am CET | 2:30pm IST | 5pm SGT
* an "afternoon session" 10am ET | 3pm UTC | 4pm CETÂ | 8:30pm IST | 7am PT (sorry)
