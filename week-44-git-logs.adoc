= Week 44 - Git Commit History
:imagesdir: img

This time Alex, couldn't make it, hope he gets better soon.

Some interesting things that happened since last weekend

* Went to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiMinixSXII[Dungeons and Dragons: Honor among Thieves^] with the kids (was really good)
* Played a lot with GPT-4
* Missed the https://www.dw.com/en/asteroid-to-zip-between-earth-and-moon-without-collision/a-65120155[asteroid DZ2 2023^], due to cloudy sky :(
* Been running Arc browser, which is really neat https://www.lennyspodcast.com/competing-with-giants-an-inside-look-at-how-the-browser-company-builds-product-josh-miller-ceo/[Invite here in the show-notes^]
* Went to a local whisky festival which was great for tasting rare spirits

Between everything I saw the TIL-post by Simon Willison about his https://til.simonwillison.net/jq/git-log-json[GPT-4 coding exercise to turn git logs into JSON output^].

He uses the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[swiss army knife of JSON processing jq^], which is awesome.

His post inspired me to to todays session on looking at *git commit history* as a graph.

== Data Source and Preparation

We're using Neo4j's open source repository here for our experiment: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j

Clone the repository (I limited it to the `5.6` branch) and follow along.

Simon did two interesting things

1. Using `git log --pretty` with NULL-bytes as separators (instead of commas or tabs)
2. Using jq to parse split the raw string by those NULL bytes and outpt JSON for the fields

[source,shell]
----
git log --date=iso --pretty=format:'%H%x00%an%x00%ad%x00%s%x00' | head -2 | \
  jq -R -s '[split("\n")[:-1] | map(split("\u0000")) | .[] | {
    "commit": .[0],
    "author": .[1],
    "date": .[2],
    "message": .[3]
  }]'
----

The output is:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "commit": "5ad4387ed521f169a737f9836402dbac8759a9fc",
    "author": "Johannes Donath",
    "date": "2023-03-08 16:17:12 +0100",
    "message": "Corrected an issue in which the number of writable bytes is incorrectly calculated. ()"
  },
  {
    "commit": "c53e91519eca145c6879d5c9be9a421fdd223338",
    "author": "Tobias Johansson",
    "date": "2023-03-07 13:34:12 +0100",
    "message": "Do polling of the fabric transaction lock in terminate"
  }
]
----

The placeholders in the pretty-print string are a bit ominous but the man page and the https://devhints.io/git-log-format[cheat-sheet here^] help a lot.

I wanted to add the parent commit via `%P` to see the git commit history chain.
Also tried to get one of the files of the commit in but we'll leave that for another time.

The other change that we need to do is to turn the data into a CSV not a JSON file.
Fortunately jq also supports CSV as an output so we can select our 5 fields and tell it to send it through the `@csv` processing step.

[source,shell]
----
echo 'commit,parent,author,date,message' > ~/Downloads/neo4j-git.csv
git log --date=iso --pretty=format:'%H%x00%P%x00%an%x00%ad%x00%s%x00' | \
  jq -r -R -s 'split("\n")[:-1] | map(split("\u0000")) | .[] | [
   .[0],
   .[1],
   .[2],
   .[3],
   .[4]
  ] | @csv' >> ~/Downloads/neo4j-git.csv
----

We can check the resulting CSV file with https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv[the `xsv` tool^] and see that it has the 76k commits and right fields, it's about 14MB of data.

[source,shell]
----
xsv count ~/Downloads/neo4j-git.csv         
76567

xsv stats ~/Downloads/neo4j-git.csv

Ok, now we have everything to turn those commits into a graph.

Are you ready?

Let's first spin up an Neo4j AuraDB database and get the data imported.

include::connect-aura.adoc[database="Git Logs"]

After opening Neo4j Workspace via the "Open" button, and logging in with the downloaded credentials, we can go to the "Import" tab and get started.

== Data Modeling

The data model is pretty straightforward, we just have `Commit` and `Author` nodes connected by a `WROTE` relationship.

The commits are also pointing to their parent commit via a `PARENT` relationship.

image::git-model.png[]

Now we can add our CSV file and map the attributes and select our id-fields.

* Commit (hash, date, parent, subject)
* Author (author)

image::git-data-importer.png[]

With the data mapped we can "Preview" our import and inspect nodes and relationship attributes and structure to see if we messed anything up.

image::git-import-preview.png[]

As we're good we can click "Import" and get after a few seconds the results presented.
There you can also inspect the Cypher statements used to create the data which you can use in your own code or scripts.

The image below is from a 2nd run, so the data is already in the graph.

image::git-import-results.png[]

== Explore

Now with "Start Exploring" we head over to the "Explore" tab and see data in the graph.

image::git-bloom.png[]

There we can also style our nodes and for instance determine shortest paths between commits (select two nodes and right click for the context menu).

image::git-bloom-shortest-path.png[]

Now let's get our hands dirty and write some Cypher statements.

== Query & Evolve

Opening the left sidebar shows us the labels and relationship-types in the graph, we can click on any of them to see a subset of our data.

image::git-query.png[]

Now we can start to explore a bit,

First looking at total number of commits and authors:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Commit) RETURN count(*)
// 76k

MATCH (:Author) RETURN count(*)
// 338
----

=== Contributor Activity

Let's find the most active authors, we can can out their outgoing relationships.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Author) 
WITH a, count { (a)-[:WROTE]->() } as commits
ORDER BY commits DESC LIMIT 10
RETURN a.author, commits
----

Which gives us these folks:

[%autowidth, opts=header, format="tsv"]
|===
a.author	commits
Mattias Persson	6592
Anders Nawroth	4106
Pontus Melke	4030
MishaDemianenko	3989
Andres Taylor	3640
Chris Vest	2983
Jacob Hansson	2521
Anton Persson	2212
Mattias Finné	2148
Davide Grohmann	1987
|===

The usual suspects :)

Oh, Mattias has been with us for 15 years but got married in between, so he shows up with two different names.

Let's fix that and move the 6592 relationships from his old alter-ego to the new one:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (new:Author { author: "Mattias Finné"})
MATCH (old:Author { author: "Mattias Persson"})
MATCH (old)-[rel:WROTE]->(c:Commit)
CREATE (new)-[:WROTE]->(c)
DELETE rel
RETURN count(*);
----

So that should fix the results:

[%autowidth, opts=header, format="tsv"]
|===
a.author	commits
Mattias Finné	8740
Anders Nawroth	4106
Pontus Melke	4030
MishaDemianenko	3989
Andres Taylor	3640
Chris Vest	2983
Jacob Hansson	2521
Anton Persson	2212
Davide Grohmann	1987
Satia Herfert	1896
|===


If we wanted to limit the people by commit-date, so we see who has been more active recently, we can do that too:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Author)
WITH a, count { (a)-[:WROTE]->(c:Commit) WHERE c.date > datetime("2019-01-01T00:00:00")} as commits
ORDER BY commits DESC LIMIT 10
RETURN a.author, commits 
----

Now we have a smaller set of people:

[%autowidth, opts=header, format="tsv"]
|===
a.author	commits
MishaDemianenko	1892
Pontus Melke	1570
Mattias Finné	1284
Satia Herfert	1126
Anton Persson	920
Chris Vest	746
Louise Söderström	578
Tobias Johansson	463
Therese Magnusson	439
Georgiy Kargapolov	415
|===

=== Fixing Parents

Another thing we need to fix is that some commits multiple parents not just one, so that their parent-hash was not found in the database to connect them.

We have roughly 15k commits of that kind.

----
parent: "e5697a0900ff849f92d0ae3c88bd8e31e3163024 d26c6ab67c34a5f91cc6cfadfc75ca4b1def3bef"
----

We can fix it by 

1. finding these commits 
2. splitting the parent field by space
3. turning that list of hashes into rows
4. find the parent commit with the hash
5. create the relationships

Or in Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
// find commits without PARENT relationship but with multiple parent hash values
MATCH (c:Commit) 
WHERE NOT exists { (c)-[:PARENT]->() }
  AND c.parent contains ' '

// split by space into list of hashes
WITH c, split(c.parent,' ') as parents

// turn list into rows
UNWIND parents as parent

// find parent commit
MATCH (p:Commit {hash:parent})

/// create relationship
MERGE (c)-[:PARENT]->(p)

RETURN count(*);
----

Now our graph is better connected, and we can run a few long path queries:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (c:Commit)-[:PARENT*100]->(p:Commit)
RETURN path LIMIT 1
----

Which gives us this beautiful long, flowery chain of commits

image::git-query-long-path.png[]


We can also look at "root" commits and see which ones have the most children.

With `PROFILE` we can sneak under the hood and see how the query planner optimizes this query, it completes in about 2 seconds checking 10-hop paths for all 76k commits.

[source,cypher]
----
profile 
match (c)-[:PARENT*..10]->(p:Commit)
with p, count(distinct c) as children
return p {.*} as parent, children order by children desc limit 10
----

Some of them have more than 600 children even only up to level 10!

image::git-query-profile.png[]

We can do the same without an upper limit but for a subset of commits:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE 
MATCH (p:Commit) WITH p LIMIT 1000
MATCH (c)-[:PARENT*]->(p)
WITH p, count(distinct c) as children
RETURN p, children ORDER BY children DESC LIMIT 10
----

image::git-query-profile2.png[]

And with that we were out of time and had covered a lot of ground.

Hope this was as much for for you as for me,

Happy Graphing.
