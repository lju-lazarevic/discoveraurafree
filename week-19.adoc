== Week 19 - Discover AuraDB Free - The Wordle Graph
:imagesdir: img

I know I'm late to the game as https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/[Wordle^] was sold to the New York Times last week.

I haven't played it much myself just saw it popping up on my twitter stream a lot.

If you haven't played *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle[wordle^]* yourself, it is a guessing game similar to mastermind, only with (5-letter) english words (there are now many clones in other languages).
Correctly guessed letters in the right position appear green, wrong position yellow and incorrect letters gray.
The goal is to guess the word in 6 attempts, i.e. make all 5 letters green.

Our creative folks even created a Neo4j version of it, see if you can spot the mistake.

So I thought one late night that it would be fun to represent the wordle world as a graph. And here we go.

https://twitter.com/mesirii/status/1488657605799321600

If you missed our live-stream here is the recording, we had a lot of fun both playing the game but also exploring the graph version of it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1rb05Ix4ag

That wordle of the day was "elder", which got got to in attempt 3, after someone from the stream hinting at it.

You can find https://neo4j.com/video/discover-aura-free-with-fun-datasets/[past live sessions^] and https://medium.com/neo4j/search?q=week+1[deep dive blog write-ups^].

All the Cypher statements and the source CSV can be found in this GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/jexp/wordle-graph

But let's create our database instance first, so that you can follow the modeling and import.

include::connect-aura.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Dataset

I found a scraped wordle list in this https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wordle/blob/main/R/words.R[repository of an R solver^], which I turned into a CSV with 12k entries.

Here are the first few words, none of which I would have associated with English :)

----
aahed
aalii
aargh
aarti
abaca
----

The https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jexp/wordle-graph/main/wordle.csv[CSV is available on GitHub^], it doesn't have a header and only a single column.

=== Import

We can load the CSV data directly with LOAD CSV into `Word` nodes, first we create a constraint to make this and future lookups fast and the import repeatable.

[source,cypher]
----
// create constraint
CREATE CONSTRAINT word_name IF NOT EXISTS ON (w:Word) ASSERT w.name IS UNIQUE;

// load csv and turn each row into a Word node

LOAD CSV FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jexp/wordle-graph/main/wordle.csv" AS row
MERGE (:Word {name:row[0]});
----

That's a lot of 5-letter words (12k) nodes.

image::wordle-bloom.png[]

I also put a dump file on s3: https://data.neo4j.com/wordle.dump that you can load into your AuraDB or Neo4j Desktop.

=== Tale of 2 Models

The idea is to split the words into their constituent letters and represent those "character positions" in the graph, sharing letters and positions as needed.

That will allow us to later query things like

* character frequency
* follow frequencies
* top-starter words
* possible solution words if we have already some positive and negative clues

==== Model 1 - Letter Positions as Nodes

Initially I represented characters at positions with dedicated nodes labeled `CharAtPos` with a `char` and an `idx` property connected to the word via `HAS` and to each other with an `NEXT` relationship and the first node (idx=0) having an extra `STARTS` relationship.

As it turns out the model might have been a bit overengineered :)

Here is the code to split the words into characters and then create the first `CharAt` pos and subsequent (1..4) nodes and connect them.

To make it work with memory constrained environments I wrapped it in a `CALL {} IN TRANSACTIONS` subquery, but even in AuraDB Free that was actually not necessary.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (w:Word) 
CALL { WITH w 
WITH w, split(w.name,"") AS chars
MERGE (start:CharAtPos {idx:0, char:chars[0]})
MERGE (w)-[:STARTS]->(start)
MERGE (w)-[:HAS]->(start)
WITH *
UNWIND range(1,size(chars)-1) AS idx
MERGE (next:CharAtPos {idx:idx, char:chars[idx]})
MERGE (w)-[:HAS]->(next)
WITH *
MATCH (prev:CharAtPos {idx:idx-1, char:chars[idx-1]})
MERGE (prev)-[:NEXT]->(next)
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS;
----

IF we query a word like `crash` now based on our model:


[source,cypher]
----
match p=(:Word {name:"crash"})--()
return p
----

image::wordle-crash.png[]

==== Wordle Solver (v1)

To solve a word, you pass in the letters you know with their positions and the letters that you don't have the right position for and match any words that fit this pattern.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c1:CharAtPos {idx:0, char:'c'}), 
      (c5:CharAtPos {idx:4, char:'h'}),
      (c:CharAtPos {char:'a'})
match (w:Word)-[:HAS]->(c1),
      (w)-[:HAS]->(c5),
      (w)-[:HAS]->(c)
return w.name;
----

----

│"crash" │
└────────┘
----

image::wordle-solver.png[]

If we have more information, then we can extend the query by excluding letters or positions and get a smaller result set.
It takes a bit longer to query due to the exclusions.

[source,cypher]
----
match (c1:CharAtPos {idx:0, char:'c'}), // correct 
      (c2:CharAtPos {idx:1, char:'a'}), // wrong pos     
      (c3:CharAtPos {char:'l'}),  // incorrect    
      (c4:CharAtPos {char:'i'}),  // incorrect
      (c5:CharAtPos {idx:4, char:'h'}), // correct
      (c:CharAtPos {char:'a'})
match (w:Word)-[h1:HAS]->(c1),
      (w)-[h2:HAS]->(c5), (w)-[h3:HAS]->(c)
WHERE not exists { (w)-[:HAS]->(c2) } and not exists { (w)-[:HAS]->(c3) } and not exists { (w)-[:HAS]->(c4) }
return *
----

==== Model 2 Positions in Relationships

An alternative model represents just the 26 characters and puts the position onto the relationship either as a property or as the rel-type.

Because we know we have 5 letters we can just spell it out.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (w:Word) 
WITH w, split(w.name,"") AS chars
MERGE (c0:Char {char:chars[0]})
MERGE (w)-[p0:POS0]->(c0) SET p0.idx = 0
MERGE (c1:Char {char:chars[1]})
MERGE (w)-[p1:POS1]->(c1) SET p1.idx = 1
MERGE (c2:Char {char:chars[2]})
MERGE (w)-[p2:POS2]->(c2) SET p2.idx = 2
MERGE (c3:Char {char:chars[3]})
MERGE (w)-[p3:POS3]->(c3) SET p3.idx = 3
MERGE (c4:Char {char:chars[4]})
MERGE (w)-[p4:POS4]->(c4) SET p4.idx = 4;
----

==== Model 2 Explorations

We can first look at the representation of a word ("diver") in this model.

[source,cypher]
----
match (w:Word {name:"diver"})-[r]->(c:Char)
return *;
----

image::wordle-diver.png[]

Then see how shared characters between two words ("diver" and "elder") look like, here `c` are the shared letters and c1, c2 the other letters respectively.

[source,cypher]
----
match path = (c1:Char)<--(:Word {name:"diver"})-->(c:Char)
match path2 = (c:Char)<--(:Word {name:"elder"})-->(c2:Char)
return path, path2;
----

image::wordle-shared-letters2.png[]

Looking at that frequent suffix of `er`, we wanted to see what the letter frequencies look like.

==== Letter Frequencies

With this model we can also easy look at character frequencies and follow probabilities.

For the letter frequencies we just count the number of relationships pointing to a character node (aka the in-degree).

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Char)
RETURN c.char, size((c)<--()) as deg
ORDER BY deg DESC;
----

As expected for the English language the vowels, and `R`,`S`,`T` are pretty high up.

We can now use that information to find good starting words, by summing up the character frequencies for each word.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (w:Word)
MATCH (w)-->(c:Char)
RETURN w.name, sum(size((c)<--())) as total
ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 5;
----

We see there are quite a lot of "cheater" words which contain the high frequency characters multiple times.

Still not perfect, most of these are just variations of the same set of letters.

Globally we can either do a big union and sum them up as we did on the stream.
Or with the positions on the relationships, we can also generalize our statement from above.

WHERE p1.idx +1 = p2.idx

These can help us finding that missing letter, but I guess you have internalized it already from your language knowledge, except for some rare combinations.

One interesting question we wanted to answer is, which letters appear frequently in succession as double-letters.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Char)<-[r1]-(w:Word)-[r2]->(c)
WHERE r1.idx = r2.idx +1
RETURN c.char, count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq DESC LIMIT 8

As expected `o` and `e` lead the pack, `l` was a bit surprising to me.

For generic, repeats and re-occurrences one could generalize that to

==== Solver v2

For resolving our wordle puzzle (v1) we could use this Cypher using this time the relationships as structuring means.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Char {char:'c'}), 
      (h:Char {char:'h'}),
      (a:Char {char:'a'})
MATCH (wordle:Word)-[p0:POS0]->(c),
      (wordle)-[p4:POS4]->(h),
      (wordle)-[px]->(a)
WHERE not exists { (wordle)-[:POS1]->(a) } 
  AND not exists { (wordle)-[:POS2]->(:Char {char:'l'}) } 
  AND not exists { (wordle)-[:POS3]->(:Char {char:'i'}) }
RETURN *;
----

image::wordle-rel-model.png[]

If we have more information, then we can extend the query by excluding letters or positions and get a smaller result set.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Char {char:'c'}), 
      (h:Char {char:'h'}),
      (a:Char {char:'a'})
MATCH (wordle:Word)-[p0:POS0]->(c),
      (wordle)-[p4:POS4]->(h),
      (wordle)-[px]->(a)
WHERE not exists { (wordle)-[:POS1]->(a) } 
  AND not exists { (wordle)-[:POS2]->(:Char {char:'l'}) } 
  AND not exists { (wordle)-[:POS3]->(:Char {char:'i'}) }
RETURN *;
----
image::wordle-rel-model-exclusions.png[]

We can even go so far as to implement a *generic solver*, that takes an structured input (we could also split an parse a marked up word as shown in the 2nd statement) and for each position, includes or excludes the letter (at position) as needed.

[source,cypher]
----
// Laser 🟩🟨⬜🟩⬜
WITH [{char:'l',match:true},{char:'a'},{char:'s',match:false},{char:'e',match:true},{char:'r',match:false}] as input
MATCH (w:Word)
CALL {
    WITH w, input
    UNWIND range(0,size(input)-1) as idx
    WITH size(input) as total, idx, w, input[idx].match as m, input[idx].char as char
    // for matching must match position
    WHERE (m AND exists { (w)-[{idx:idx}]->(:Char {char:char}) })
    // for non-matching must not contain  
      OR (m = false AND NOT exists { (w)-->(:Char {char:char}) })
    // existing must contain somewhere
      OR (m IS NULL AND exists { (w)-->(:Char {char:char}) })
    // all conditions need to match for this word
    WITH total, count(*) as count WHERE count = total
    RETURN true AS found
}
RETURN w.name;
----

For 'laser' this returns 9 suggestions for the next word: label, laced, lacet, lacey, laded, laden, laked, lamed, lapel, lated, laten, latex, laved, lawed, laxed, layed, lazed, lutea, lycea.

We could now rank them by the information gain, i.e. which of those have high frequency new characters or reduce most of the uncertainty.

I leave that for you valued reader for now, so that we can have a look at (the much simpler) wordle game implemented using Cypher.

=== Playing wordle in your Terminal

If you just want to play, run `./wordle-neo4j.sh` in your terminal, it sends a Cypher query to a wordle database in demo.neo4j.labs.com (username, password, database = wordle) to see if your guesses were right.

return reduce(res='', idx in range(0,size(letters)-1) | res + 
  // when correct
  case when guessed[idx] = letters[idx] then '🟩' 
  // when contained

  // otherwise  
  else '⬜' end) as res

*_Happy guessing and playing with the wordle data!_*

Let us know if you have more ideas / suggestions on how to have more fun with this or other datasets on AuraDB Free.

////
=== Ideas

* explain two models
* loading
* post-processing
* look at char frequencies
* recommend starting words (based on top frequencies)
* rarest words
* solve word
* visualize solver
* input word so far, e.g. `C a l! i! H` and have a generic cypher-statement to run with this word
* implement wordle -> split input + match
